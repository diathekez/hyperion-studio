# [Hyperion Studio](https://hyperionstud.io/)

This is my studio's website. It's modern and efficient, but also creative and attractive.

The website was developed with HTML, Sass, jQuery, and Hammer.js. I used some stock images from Unsplash. The rest of the graphics were done by hand on Photoshop and Illustrator.

The code for this website was cloned from [BuckyMaler](https://github.com/BuckyMaler/global). Please clone his repo rather than this one. The About page was done with a Bootstrap template that I edited to fit the color palette and scheme of the main website.
